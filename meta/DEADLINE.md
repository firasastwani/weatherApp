## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

    I learned how to extract specific pieces of information from long JSON strings
    by creating seperate new classes and GSON to parse wanted information.

    I also learned how to access online APIs using API Tokens for different APIs

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

    I would focus more on building a nicer GUI as I would
    already know what to do with the backend API part
